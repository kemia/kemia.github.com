title: Kemia Reaction Editor
---

#Introduction and Welcome

Welcome to kemia! An open source (Apache Licensed) chemical structure and reaction editor. Our mission is to create the world’s first open source, 100% javascript chemistry toolkit.  

Why?  Because chemists are asking for tools that run in a web browser and scientific discovery works better when collaborative technologies, like the web, are utilized in a scientific context. This work is a collaboration between open source developers at the [European Bioinformatics Institute](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ "EBI") and [Wingu Inc.](http://www.wingu.com "Wingu")
